              <li> Was it the content alone, or was it how the speaker delivered the content? </li> 
              ‣ I really do enjoy the content as alone type scenario for this he was very enthusiastic to his passion to know and keep learning.
              <li>  What made the content appealing? What made it relatable?</li>
             ‣ He related to me in a way for technology and how we as humans can teach the model to train the AI to Bots to be doing the multitude of tasks as we start growing as an information highway of the resources of the internet.               
              <li> How did the speaker draw you in to care about the subject/topic?   </li>
            ‣  I'm really interested in AI/Machine Learning models to the frameworks to integrate the state of data to be passed into a computer to be called as they automate for themselves as calculating algorithms to further create our lives easier but fine borderline of enabling limitations for future dependencies for the structure.
            <li>  What did you get out of the presentation that you would not have experienced reading an article about the topic? </li>

                      ‣  He created a calm atmosphere by possessing others to have joy with watching him speak about his skillsets and humbled himself knowing that knowledge is to train the models but that AI/Bots can store learning.

                <h1>Why domestic violence victims don't leave</h1>

              <hr/>
              <div>
 <p>Leslie Morgan Steiner was in "crazy love" -- that is, madly in love with a man who routinely abused her and threatened her life. Steiner tells the story of her relationship, correcting misconceptions many people hold about victims of domestic
                  violence, and explaining how we can all help break the silence. This talk was presented to a local audience at TEDxRainier, an independent event. TED's editors chose to feature it for you.

                </p>
                <p>Editor's note: This talk was recorded at a TEDx event organized by volunteers; speakers are selected independently of TED.</p>

                <h1>Presentation Analysis:Assignment</h1>
           <!--     TODO -->       <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This is one of the favorite talks I had heard in a while. He was both funny and easy to listen to throughout the seminar.
                <br/> Every time I watch a video, I do not watch it. I often times listen to it first. Before anything, I always want to know what I'm ingesting and taking in before storing it as a source of reference. Many have different approaches but this is my best way to know if the subject is best to be seen.   Content is so important in patterning the way you present things to the public in design or especially if projecting a dynamic approach.  
                <br/>   Ken Jennings is a skillful person who learned a lot of things through factual pursuit. He was one of the few who had made it through Jeopardy. He had the confidence to win. 
                                            </p>
