              <li>  What made the content appealing? What made it relatable?</li>
             ‣ He related to me in a way for technology and how we as humans can teach the model to train the AI to Bots to be doing the multitude of tasks as we start growing as an information highway of the resources of the internet.               
              <li> How did the speaker draw you in to care about the subject/topic?   </li>
            ‣  I'm really interested in AI/Machine Learning models to the frameworks to integrate the state of data to be passed into a computer to be called as they automate for themselves as calculating algorithms to further create our lives easier but fine borderline of enabling limitations for future dependencies for the structure.
            <li>  What did you get out of the presentation that you would not have experienced reading an article about the topic? </li>

                      ‣  He created a calm atmosphere by possessing others to have joy with watching him speak about his skillsets and humbled himself knowing that knowledge is to train the models but that AI/Bots can store learning.

           <!--     TODO -->       <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This is one of the favorite talks I had heard in a while. He was both funny and easy to listen to throughout the seminar.
                <br/> Every time I watch a video, I do not watch it. I often times listen to it first. Before anything, I always want to know what I'm ingesting and taking in before storing it as a source of reference. Many have different approaches but this is my best way to know if the subject is best to be seen.   Content is so important in patterning the way you present things to the public in design or especially if projecting a dynamic approach.  
                <br/>   Ken Jennings is a skillful person who learned a lot of things through factual pursuit. He was one of the few who had made it through Jeopardy. He had the confidence to win. 
                                            </p>
