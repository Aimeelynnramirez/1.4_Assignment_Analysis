  <h1>Nick's Ted Talk</h1>
 <li> It was moving because he gave insights towards humanity to the great ape. He gave insights of evolving and to be similar to each other. That we are dormant in comparison to our potential.</li> 
 <li> I enjoyed this presentation because it gave me knowledge toward AI to Machine Learning. In the future can be able to cross all domains, this can be accessed and can be open to all domains. </li> 
 <li> The way it was given was giving statistics to GDP plotting. Neurons to comparing computer neurons to be traveling the speed of light.</li>
 <li> He gave such a great speech of us having the storage of more than a computer's storage point. It was relatable because he gave a nice plot line to where the AI is lower than our "Village Idiot". That he gave a relation of personal limitations to what AI has to achieve. He gave a picture of the robot from the Terminator. That was funny. Human processing to physically to matters relating to Computer processing. </li>
 <li> I'm really interested in AI/Machine Learning models to the frameworks to integrate the state of data to be passed into a computer to be called as they automate for themselves as calculating algorithms to further create our lives easier but fine borderline of enabling limitations for future dependencies for the structure. He claims that Machine Learning will be the last thing we could ever need to create.  </li>
 <li>He gave a good vast topic overview on many things I had the interest of such as the limiting factors to what we need to achieve in order for us to get to the level of AI/Machine intelligence we so hope for. He gave a statistic of what years to be achieving these goals to earliest 2022 - 2075. AI starts with zero intelligence. This will take years to get to mouse level, to chimp level, Village idiot, to Ed Witten. When our idea of "super-intelligence" can be better in digital aspects it can change the world. "We need to think as has optimization process",  this it turns the world to achieve the state with to find the means of what it needs to achieve the objective.</li> 
 <li> He created a great visual attribute by the ways we can let AI feel emotion.  He gives a passion towards if we give this the best to its ability it can create our vision of output. We could potentially not be best for our generations to come being dependant on technology. </li>

          <h2 id="review">Review Summary</h2>
            <p>This is a great insight towards the what is AI to Machine learning. We live to understand that it can be like the Terminator, to be taking over the world. 
                <br/>That he gives good views of what the limits to this goal to the output we can achieve. <br/>
                 There are good points he had used to statistics to be one of the favorable points he had used during this approach.
                 <br/>   He gave good views to AI having zero intelligence at first developing.
