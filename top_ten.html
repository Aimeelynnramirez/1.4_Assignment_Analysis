                                  <p>Every time I watch a video, I do not watch it. I often times listen to it first. Before anything, I always want to know what I'm ingesting and taking in before storing it as a source of reference. Many have different approaches but this is my best way to know if the subject is best to be seen.   Content is so important in patterning the way you present things to the public in design or especially if projecting a dynamic approach.  </p>

                                    Step 2: Create a document for this assignment and include supporting visual imagery. Using the Questions outlined in Step 1 as a guide, write a short analysis of each of the TED Talks you watched. Each analysis should include specific examples of elements that contributed to a powerful presentation or that weakened the presentation. Explain what worked and what did not. Step 3:Conclude your assignment with your own list of ten (10) qualities, techniques, and/or presentation skills that made the presentations you watched inspiring, captivating, creative, and effective (from your own perspective). Provide specific examples from the presentations to support your claim and explain why these elements contributed to a powerful presentation. How are these similar or different from what you have read? Consider the practices that were common among the speakers in all of the videos you watched. Examples of qualities, techniques, and presentation skills:“The speaker opened the presentation with a question.” “The speaker closed the presentation with a question or call to action.”“The speaker maintained eye contact with the audience throughout the presentation.”You may use a tool familiar to you for this assignment.
