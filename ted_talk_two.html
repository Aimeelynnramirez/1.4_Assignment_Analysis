                 <h1>Raphael's Ted Talk</h1>
            <li> Why was this presentation powerful or moving?   </li> 
              ‣It was moving and powerful because he gives an artistic aspect to the what humans are to work on teaching emotion to as a qualitative quality to a computer, artificial intelligence. 
               <li> Why did you like this presentation?   </li> 
              ‣I liked it because he was giving the poetic comparison to what makes us human. Viewing the small attributes that we take for granted. We smell and laugh for many open environmental and complexity. 
              <li>  Was it the content alone, or was it how the speaker delivered the content?   </li> 
              ‣ I really did the real aspect to the how he had explained the sentiment score to transferring emotion to AI.
              <li>  What made the content appealing? What made it relatable?   </li> 
              ‣ He related to me as an artist to best to view intuitive approaches. He does an explain about wayfinding which is a  symbolic compass. 
              <li>  How did the speaker draw you in to care about the subject/topic?   </li> 
              ‣ I'm really interested in AI/Machine Learning models to the frameworks to integrate the state of data to be passed into a computer to be called as they automate for themselves as calculating algorithms to further create our lives easier but fine borderline of enabling limitations for future dependencies for the structure.
              <li>  What did you get out of the presentation that you would not have experienced reading an article about the topic?   </li> 
              ‣ I have seen his methods of explaining through intuitions can be mapped to the outcomes to the machine to respond.  I now understand the artistic way that is able to embed the more human qualities to AI. 
              <li>  What kinds of emotions did the presenter elicit? How did they do this?   </li> 
              ‣ He created a very relatable atmosphere. He was sensitive to the topic to which I really enjoyed as a viewer. He touched upon the human's emotional standpoint that cannot be registered as a real emotional feeling if given by a machine.

          <h2 id="review">Review Summary</h2>
          <p>This was the first video I had watched along with the other videos. This gave the most interest to my wants to achieve in this ideal goal. 
            <br/>He gives such a beautiful way of achieving such a qualitative overview to be given as a solidarity unique quality we achieve as humans. 
            <br>I believe his standpoint was the most relatable view of all three and I really did enjoy his limitation of using diagrams but what to was needed. He did make it a sensitive overview of gestures to regarding the topic.
